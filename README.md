# Pontoon Security Audits

We felt that combining our formal verification efforts with more traditional security audits would be the best method for maximising security. As a result, we teamed with five leading independent security auditors to safeguard the contract logic against logical mistakes and potential failure modes.

**The specialists listed below concentrate on security and traditional auditing:**
- **[BlockSec](https://www.blocksecteam.com/)** - security reviews of our smart contracts.
- **[PeckShield](https://peckshield.com/)** - traditional audit.
- **[Coinspect](https://www.coinspect.com/)** - security reviews of our smart contracts.
- **[SlowMist](https://www.slowmist.com/)** - security reviews of our smart contracts.
- **[Zokyo](https://www.zokyo.io/)** - smart contracts audit.
